      "Why are liNEAR and Meta Pool the only supported staking pools for House of Stake?",
    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The goal of House of Stake is to make onboarding as seamless as
          possible. Liquid staking tokens, such as liNEAR and stNEAR, allow
          users to instantly transfer and lock tokens for voting power, without
          any disruption to your staking rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that being said, House of Stake contracts support any staking

          House of Stake&apos;s primary focus is to give NEAR token holders a

    answer:
      "In the current House of Stake contracts, users can deposit liNEAR or stNEAR into the lockup contract, but the design does not support direct transfers of these tokens out of the contract. Instead, users must unstake the tokens back to native NEAR before withdrawal as a workaround. This stems from an initial focus on staking functionality rather than full transferability, with fungible token transfers complicated by pricing dependencies not denominated in NEAR. The lockup contract is non-upgradable, making this behavior fixed for the lifetime of the V1 lockup contract. This will be addressed in a future version of House of Stake.",

Delegates play a crucial role in ensuring informed decision-making.",

    id: "voting-power",
    question: "How is voting power calculated?",
    answer:

    answer:
      "When you lock NEAR tokens for governance, they are locked for a specific period. During this time, you cannot transfer or use these tokens for other purposes, but you maintain voting rights and earn rewards. The locking period helps ensure long-term alignment with the protocol's success.",

    answer:

If you prefer to entrust your voting power to someone who actively participates in governance, delegation is a great option.",

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <p>
          The formula to calculate the annual total NEAR rewards paid to veNEAR
          holders is as follows:
        </p>
        <div className="p-4 text-center my-4">
          <span className="font-mono text-lg">
            NEAR<sub>rewards</sub> = NEAR<sub>locked</sub> × veNEAR

            will be set by the Screening Committee.
          </li>
          <li>
            The above formula assumes the distribution of{" "}
            <strong>
              NEAR<sub>rewards</sub>

            to be annual.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

          <strong>
            NEAR<sub>rewards</sub>
          </strong>{" "}
          in a given month/epoch, a given user is awarded based on their veNEAR
          holdings as a ratio to{" "}

            veNEAR<sub>supply</sub>

          <span className="font-mono text-lg">
            NEAR<sub>userA</sub> = NEAR<sub>rewards</sub> × (veNEAR
