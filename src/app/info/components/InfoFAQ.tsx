    answer: (
      <Text>
        NEAR House of Stake governance is a decentralized governance system that
        empowers token holders to lock NEAR for voting rights, delegate votes to
        trusted representatives, and earn rewards for active participation. It
        enables the community to collectively make decisions about the
        protocol&apos;s future.

          The goal of House of Stake is to make onboarding as seamless as

        <Text>
          House of Stake&apos;s primary focus is to give NEAR token holders a
          way to gain voting power, earn rewards, and boost rewards with
          staking. When you stake your locked NEAR tokens, you are doing so
          through your lockup contract, which is custodying your funds.

    question: "Why do I need to unstake my liNEAR and stNEAR to withdraw?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        In the current House of Stake contracts, users can deposit liNEAR or
        stNEAR into the lockup contract, but the design does not support direct
        transfers of these tokens out of the contract. Instead, users must
        unstake the tokens back to native NEAR before withdrawal as a
        workaround. This stems from an initial focus on staking functionality
        rather than full transferability, with fungible token transfers
        complicated by pricing dependencies not denominated in NEAR. The lockup
        contract is non-upgradable, making this behavior fixed for the lifetime
        of the V1 lockup contract. This will be addressed in a future version of
        House of Stake.

    id: "how-to-participate",
    question: "How can I participate in NEAR governance?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        You can participate by locking your NEAR tokens to gain voting power,
        delegating your voting power to trusted delegates who align with your
        values, or becoming a delegate yourself. All participants earn rewards
        for their active involvement in the governance process.

  {
    id: "what-are-delegates",
    question: "What are delegates and why are they important?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        Delegates are community members who have been entrusted with voting
        power by token holders. They actively participate in governance by
        voting on proposals, engaging in discussions, and representing the
        interests of those who delegated to them. Delegates play a crucial role
        in ensuring informed decision-making.

  },
  {
    id: "voting-power",
    question: "How is voting power calculated?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        Voting power is determined by the amount of NEAR tokens you have locked
        in the governance contract. The more NEAR you lock, the more voting
        power you have. You can either use this voting power directly or
        delegate it to others while still maintaining ownership of your tokens.

  },
  {
    id: "locking-period",
    question: "What is the token locking period?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        When you lock NEAR tokens for governance, they are locked for a specific
        period. During this time, you cannot transfer or use these tokens for
        other purposes, but you maintain voting rights and earn rewards. The
        locking period helps ensure long-term alignment with the protocol&apos;s
        success.

    answer: (

        The choice depends on your level of engagement and expertise. If you
        have the time and knowledge to research proposals thoroughly, direct
        voting gives you full control. If you prefer to entrust your voting
        power to someone who actively participates in governance, delegation is
        a great option.

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-6">
        <Text>
          Non-Liquid Staking Pools are traditional NEAR staking pools that
          don&apos;t provide liquid staking tokens (like liNEAR or stNEAR). If
          you have NEAR staked with one of these pools, you can still
          participate in House of Stake governance by bringing those staked
          tokens into the system.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          House of Stake now supports whitelisted Non-Liquid Staking Pools,
          allowing you to stake directly with any pool on the whitelist rather
          than only the liquid staking providers. This is useful if you:

            How the Staking Pool Whitelist Works
          </p>
          <Text>
            House of Stake uses a whitelist contract to control which staking
            pools can be used with lockup contracts. This security measure
            ensures that only trusted, verified staking pools can receive
            delegated funds. When you select a staking pool, the lockup contract
            verifies the pool is whitelisted before allowing the selection.
          </Text>
          <div className="mt-4 space-y-3">
            <Text>
              The whitelist contract address is configured in the veNEAR
              contract and can be viewed via the{" "}
              <Code>staking_pool_whitelist_account_id</Code> field in the{" "}
              <Code>get_config</Code> response. The whitelist is governed by
              House of Stake, and new pools can be added through the governance
              proposal process.
            </Text>
            <Text>
              When you enter a pool account ID in the UI, the system
              automatically checks the whitelist to verify the pool is allowed.
              If a pool is not whitelisted, you will see an error message and
              won&apos;t be able to select it.

    answer: (
      <Text>
        The current contract architecture only allows one LST position to be
        locked at a time. Concurrent locking of multiple LSTs is not supported
        in House of Stake V1. When you lock NEAR tokens for governance, they are
        locked for a specific period. During this time, you cannot transfer or
        use these tokens for other purposes, but you maintain voting rights and
        earn rewards. The locking period helps ensure long-term alignment with
        the protocol&apos;s success.

        Locking your NEAR demonstrates long-term commitment to the NEAR
        ecosystem. When you lock NEAR, you receive veNEAR in return. For a
        limited time, House of Stake is offering additional rewards for every
        NEAR you lock.

        will appear. Click it to initiate the transfer of your rewards. You’ll
        receive NEAR directly into your lockup address, and your wallet balance
        will update accordingly. Rewards will be released in multiple rounds
        over a three-month period. By keeping your veNEAR locked, you’ll
        automatically participate in all upcoming rounds until the veNEAR
        rewards campaign concludes.

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <Text>
          Your rewards increase based on how much NEAR you lock and how long you
          lock it for. Please note: The total amount of veNEAR rewards
          distributed depends on the overall NEAR participation in the rewards
          campaign.

          Your individual allocation scales with your lock amount and lock

        <Text>
          You can also increase your overall participation rewards by staking
          NEAR (optional). Combining locking and staking may increase your
          overall participation rewards, depending on program parameters. For

    id: "unlock-venear-immediately",
    question: "Can I unlock my veNEAR immediately after claiming rewards?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        Yes. Claiming rewards is independent of locking mechanics. You can
        unlock your veNEAR at any time. However, we encourage you to keep your
        veNEAR locked and delegate it to participate in governance and
        decision-making at House of Stake. Staying locked and delegated
        strengthens the ecosystem and gives you an active voice in shaping
        NEAR&apos;s future.

        No. Rewards that have already been assigned to you remain claimable even

        No. Once you unlock veNEAR, there is a 45-day cooldown period. After the
        cooldown ends, you can withdraw your underlying NEAR.

        You must have at least 2.1 NEAR available in your wallet to qualify for
        veNEAR rewards.

  {
    id: "delegate-venear-consequences",
    question: "What happens when I delegate veNEAR to a delegator?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        Your veNEAR is burned, and new veNEAR is minted for the delegate. Your
        locked NEAR balance remains unchanged within the lockup contract. Your
        reward calculation is unaffected; delegating does not change the amount
        of rewards you receive. You can undelegate your veNEAR at any time.
