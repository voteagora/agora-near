    answer: (
      <Text>
        NEAR House of Stake governance is a decentralized governance system that
        empowers token holders to lock NEAR for voting rights, delegate votes to
        trusted representatives, and earn rewards for active participation. It
        enables the community to collectively make decisions about the
        protocol&apos;s future.

          The goal of House of Stake is to make onboarding as seamless as

          any disruption to your staking rewards.

    answer: (
      <div className="space-y-6">
        <Text>
          House of Stake&apos;s primary focus is to give NEAR token holders a
          way to gain voting power, earn rewards, and boost rewards with
          staking. When you stake your locked NEAR tokens, you are doing so
          through your lockup contract, which is custodying your funds.

    question: "Why do I need to unstake my liNEAR and stNEAR to withdraw?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        In the current House of Stake contracts, users can deposit liNEAR or
        stNEAR into the lockup contract, but the design does not support direct
        transfers of these tokens out of the contract. Instead, users must
        unstake the tokens back to native NEAR before withdrawal as a
        workaround. This stems from an initial focus on staking functionality
        rather than full transferability, with fungible token transfers
        complicated by pricing dependencies not denominated in NEAR. The lockup
        contract is non-upgradable, making this behavior fixed for the lifetime
        of the V1 lockup contract. This will be addressed in a future version of
        House of Stake.

    id: "how-to-participate",
    question: "How can I participate in NEAR governance?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        You can participate by locking your NEAR tokens to gain voting power,
        delegating your voting power to trusted delegates who align with your
        values, or becoming a delegate yourself. All participants earn rewards
        for their active involvement in the governance process.

  {
    id: "what-are-delegates",
    question: "What are delegates and why are they important?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        Delegates are community members who have been entrusted with voting
        power by token holders. They actively participate in governance by
        voting on proposals, engaging in discussions, and representing the
        interests of those who delegated to them. Delegates play a crucial role
        in ensuring informed decision-making.

  },
  {
    id: "voting-power",
    question: "How is voting power calculated?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        Voting power is determined by the amount of NEAR tokens you have locked
        in the governance contract. The more NEAR you lock, the more voting
        power you have. You can either use this voting power directly or
        delegate it to others while still maintaining ownership of your tokens.

        When you lock NEAR tokens for governance, they are locked for a specific
        period. During this time, you cannot transfer or use these tokens for
        other purposes, but you maintain voting rights and earn rewards. The

        The choice depends on your level of engagement and expertise. If you

        <Text>
          Non-Liquid Staking Pools are traditional NEAR staking pools that
          don&apos;t provide liquid staking tokens (like liNEAR or stNEAR). If
          you have NEAR staked with one of these pools, you can still

          tokens into the system.

          House of Stake now supports whitelisted Non-Liquid Staking Pools,

            How the Staking Pool Whitelist Works
          </p>
          <Text>
            House of Stake uses a whitelist contract to control which staking
            pools can be used with lockup contracts. This security measure
            ensures that only trusted, verified staking pools can receive
            delegated funds. When you select a staking pool, the lockup contract
            verifies the pool is whitelisted before allowing the selection.

              When you enter a pool account ID in the UI, the system

            After unstaking, wait for the pool&apos;s cooldown period (typically

            Once cooldown is complete, use Advanced → Withdraw all to bring
            tokens back to your lockup contract.

            Click Refresh balance to sync your lockup and surface any available

    question: "Why can't I lock more than one LST position?",
    answer: (
      <Text>
        The current contract architecture only allows one LST position to be
        locked at a time. Concurrent locking of multiple LSTs is not supported
        in House of Stake V1. When you lock NEAR tokens for governance, they are
        locked for a specific period. During this time, you cannot transfer or
        use these tokens for other purposes, but you maintain voting rights and
        earn rewards. The locking period helps ensure long-term alignment with
        the protocol&apos;s success.
