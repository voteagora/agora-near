          <p>
            Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using the
            Interface for any reason. Your use of the Interface is conditional
            upon your agreement to the Terms set out below. If you do not agree
            and you do not give your consent to be bound to the Terms, do not
            use the Interface and, if presented with the option to “accept ” to
            the Terms of use, only select “accept” if you certify that you
            consent to be bound by the Terms.

          <p>
            If you do not meet the eligibility requirements set forth in Section
            4 of the Terms or are otherwise not in strict compliance with these
            Terms, you are expressly prohibited from using, accessing, or
            deriving any benefit from the Interface and you must not attempt to
            access or use the Interface. Use of a virtual private network (e.g.,
            a VPN) or other means by ineligible persons to access or use the
            Interface is prohibited, and prohibited uses may attract legal
            liability for fraudulent use of the Interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            These Terms of Use and any terms and conditions incorporated by
            reference (collectively, the Terms) govern access to and the use of
            the Interface by each individual, entity, group, or association
            (collectively User, Users, You) who views, interacts, links to or
            otherwise uses or derives any benefit from the Interface.

          <p>
            By accessing, browsing, or using the Interface, or by acknowledging
            your agreement to the Terms on the Interface, you agree that you
            have read, understood, and consented to be bound by all of the
            Terms, including the Privacy Policy which are incorporated by
            reference to these Terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Importantly, when you agree to these Terms by using or accessing the
            Interface, you agree to a binding arbitration provision and a class
            action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes
            are resolved.
          </p>
          <p>
            From time to time and at any time, the Terms may be changed,
            amended, or revised without notice or consultation. If you do not
            agree to the revised Terms, then you should not continue to access
            or use the Interface.

              If you have any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any
              way to the Interface or these Terms, you must send an email to
              info@houseofstake.org to resolve the matter via an informal, good
              faith negotiation process. If that dispute or claim is not
              resolved within 60 days of sending such an email, then you agree
              that all unresolved disputes or claims shall be finally and
              exclusively settled by arbitration administered by the London
              Court of International Arbitration under the LCIA Arbitration
              Rules in force at the time of the filing for arbitration of such
              dispute. The arbitration shall be held before a single arbitrator

            5. About the Interface
          </h3>
          <div className="text-secondary space-y-4">
            <p>
              The Interface aggregates and presents publicly available and
              derived information related to staking activity and validator
              performance on the NEAR blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Interface also provides methods through which the User may
              indicate staking-related actions they wish to perform via the
              House of Stake smart contracts, which are deployed on the NEAR
              blockchain. These methods enable the Interface to prepare draft
              transaction messages that the User can review and execute using a
              third-party NEAR-compatible wallet or device.
            </p>
            <p>
              When used in this way, the Interface facilitates user-initiated
              interactions such as staking, unstaking, and reward claiming.
              These actions are executed solely through the User’s connected
              wallet and the House of Stake contracts. The Interface does not
              process or broadcast any transaction itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              Separately, the Interface also surfaces historical and real-time
              data through integration with the Agora Indexer. This includes
              visualizations of staking flows, validator rewards, and other
              relevant protocol data. The Indexer is read-only and provides no
              capability to initiate or execute transactions.

            6. About the Middleware
          </h3>
          <div className="text-secondary space-y-4">
            <p>The Middleware includes two distinct components:</p>
            <ol className="list-[lower-roman] pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong>House of Stake Smart Contracts</strong> — A suite of
                smart contracts deployed on the NEAR blockchain that facilitate
                delegation, undelegation, and reward interactions between Users
                and NEAR validators. These contracts are open, permissionless,
                and can be accessed directly by any User via a compatible wallet
                or client.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Agora Indexer</strong> — A dedicated component relying
                on one or more vendors to extract data from the NEAR blockchain
                and write records to a relational database that
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              The House of Stake contract layer operates independently and can
              be accessed without using the Interface. The Agora Indexer is
              fit-for-purpose and hosted only for consumption by the interface.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-primary mb-2">
            7. Interface relationship to Middleware
          </h3>
          <div className="text-secondary space-y-4">
            <p>
              Users are not required to use the Interface in order to interact
              with either the House of Stake smart contracts or the Agora
              Indexer, i.e. the Middleware. Anyone with a compatible wallet or
              API client can engage directly with the Middleware components or
              with the NEAR blockchain.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Interface maintainers do not operate or control the NEAR
              blockchain, wallet software, validator infrastructure, or
              Middleware. They simply provide a user-friendly presentation of
              publicly available data and facilitate interaction with the House
              of Stake contracts through transaction message drafting.
            </p>
            <p>
              On-chain data—including balances, delegation status, and
              transaction history—may also be accessed through NEAR-compatible
              block explorers and RPC endpoints. Off-chain data made available
              through the Agora Indexer is independently queryable and publicly
              documented.
            </p>
            <p>
              By combining publicly available information with the User’s
              actions, the Interface may generate NEAR-compatible transaction
              messages intended for use with the House of Stake contracts. These
              messages are delivered to a compatible third-party wallet selected
              by the User after choosing to connect (e.g., via a “Connect
              Wallet” button).
            </p>
            <p>
              All transaction messages must be reviewed and signed by the User.
              Signing requires the use of the User’s private key, which is never
              accessible to the Interface, its maintainers, or contributors. The
              Interface cannot initiate or broadcast transactions on behalf of
              the User.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once authorized, the transaction may be submitted by the User’s
              wallet to the NEAR blockchain. Network fees may apply. Any changes
              in token balances or delegation status resulting from such
              transactions can later be queried through the Agora Indexer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Interface and its maintainers are not agents, custodians, or
              intermediaries. They do not hold, manage, or have access to any
              tokens, private keys, passwords, or other property of the User.
              All blockchain activity is executed solely through the User’s
              interactions with the NEAR network and the Middleware. The
              Interface maintainers do not collect any compensation from Users
              for the use of the Interface.

              The Permitted Use of the Interface is exclusively to aid

              Interface for informational purposes only as an aid to their own
              research, due diligence, and decision-making. Before using any
              information from the Interface (including any draft transaction
              messages) to engage in transactions, each User must independently
              verify the accuracy of such information (and the consistency of
              such draft transaction messages with the User&#39;s intentions).

              <p>
                The Middleware, and all tokens may be subject to Forks. Forks
                occur when some or all persons running the software clients for
                a particular blockchain system adopt a new client or a new
                version of an existing client that: (i) changes the protocol
                rules in backward-compatible or backward-incompatible manner
                that affects which transactions can be added into later blocks,
                how later blocks are added to the blockchain, or other matters
                relating to the future operation of the protocol; or (ii)
                reorganizes or changes past blocks to alter the history of the
                blockchain. Some forks are “contentious” and thus may result in
                two or more persistent alternative versions of the protocol or
                blockchain, either of which may be viewed as or claimed to be
                the legitimate or genuine continuation of the original.

                12.12 — Essential Third-Party Software Dependencies
              </h4>
              <p>
                The Middleware and other relevant blockchain systems and smart
                contracts are public software utilities that are accessible
                directly through any compatible third-party node or indirectly
                through any compatible third-party “wallet” application that
                interacts with such a node. Interacting with the Middleware does
                not require the use of the Interface, but the Interface is only
                a convenient and user-friendly option of reading and displaying
                data from the Middleware and generating standard draft
                transaction messages compatible with the Middleware. The User
                may choose to interact with the Middleware using softwares other
                than the Interface. As the Interface does not provide wallet
                software applications or nodes for blockchain systems, such
                software constitutes an essential third-party software and user
                dependency without which the Middleware cannot be used and
                tokens cannot be traded or used. Furthermore, the Interface may
                use APIs and servers of Interface maintainers or third parties
                and there are no guarantees as to the continued operation,
                maintenance, availability, or security of any of the foregoing
                dependencies.
